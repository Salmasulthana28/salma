## HISTOGRAM


A histogram is a graphic representation of data in a grouped frequency distribution with continuous classes.


ANALYSIZE THE HISTOGRAM BY USING AN IMAGE IN OPENCV.

image analyses using Libraries

```
#opencv

#Matplotlib
```


The image should be used in a PNG files as matplotlib support only PNG images.Here it is 24-bits RGB PNG image  (8bits of R,G,B)

```
img = cv2.imread('/home/salma-sulthana/Downloads/abbu.png',0)
```



![abbu](https://github.com/Salmasulthana28/salma/assets/169051854/6a81e77e-0474-4046-8843-eb58fc12a299)

Here is an RGB image.In Matplotlib, this is performed using the imshow() function. Here we have grabbed the plot object.Histogram is considered as a graph or plot which is related to frequency of pixels in an Gray Scale Image
with pixel values (ranging from 0 to 255). Grayscale image is an image in which the value of each pixel is a single sample, that is, it carries only intensity information where pixel value varies from 0 to 255. Images of this sort, also known as black-and-white, are composed exclusively of shades of gray, varying from black at the weakest intensity to white at the strongest where Pixel can be considered as a every point in an image.see the image and its histogram which is drawn for grayscale image, not color image.

To create a histogram of our image data, we use the hist() function.
```
histr = cv2.calcHist([img],[0],None,[256],[0,256])
```

In our histogram, it looks like thereâ€™s distribution of intensity all over image Black and White pixels as grayscale image.

From the histogram, we can conclude that dark region is more than brighter region.

Uses for Histogram:


To display large amount of datavalues in a relatively simple chat form

To easily see the distribution of the data

To see if there is variation in the data

To make future prediction based on the data


## BOUNDING BOX


using this CSV, Crop the image and  on  the full sized images Draw bounding box

This script is designed to process images and associated bounding box data stored in a CSV file. It reads the CSV file containing bounding box coordinates for each image, draws bounding boxes on the images, and saves the resulting images with boxes outlined in red. Additionally, it crops the areas defined by the bounding boxes into separate images and saves them individually.

Required Libraries

os for file operations,

csv for CSV file read

and PIL (Python Imaging Library) for image processing.

Defining Paths: It defines paths for the CSV file, the directory containing the images, and the output directory where the processed images will be saved.

Creating Output Directory: It ensures that the output directory exists; if not, it creates it.

```
csv_file = "/home/salma-sulthana/Downloads/7622202030987_bounding_box.csv"
image_dir = "/home/salma-sulthana/Downloads/7622202030987/"
output_dir = "/home/salma-sulthana/Downloads/7622202030987_with_boxes"

```
draw_boxes(image, boxes): This function takes an image and a list of bounding boxes as input and draws rectangles around each bounding box on the image. It returns the modified image.
crop_image(image, boxes): This function crops regions defined by the bounding boxes from the input image. It returns a list of cropped images.
        It opens the CSV file and iterates over each row (each row corresponds to an image).
        For each row, it constructs the path to the corresponding image file and opens the image using Image.open() from PIL.
        It extracts bounding box coordinates from the CSV file and stores them in a list of dictionaries.
        It then calls crop_image() to crop regions defined by the bounding boxes.
        It saves each cropped image separately with a prefix indicating its order in the original image and the original image's filename.
        It calls draw_boxes() to draw bounding boxes on the original image and saves the modified image with the bounding boxes outlined in red.

This script is useful for tasks like object detection, where you have images with associated bounding box annotations and you want to visualize the bounding boxes or extract the regions defined by the bounding boxes for further analysis.




```
os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)


def draw_boxes(image, boxes):
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(image)
    for box in boxes:
        left = int(box['left'])
        top = int(box['top'])
        right = int(box['right'])
        bottom = int(box['bottom'])
        draw.rectangle([left, top, right, bottom], outline="red")
    return image


with open(csv_file, 'r') as file:
    csv_reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    for row in csv_reader:
        image_name = row['filename']
        image_path = os.path.join(image_dir, image_name)
        output_path = os.path.join(output_dir, image_name)
        image = Image.open(image_path)
        boxes = [{'left': row['xmin'], 'top': row['ymin'], 'right': row['xmax'], 'bottom': row['ymax']}]
        cropped_images = crop_image(image, boxes)
        for i, cropped_img in enumerate(cropped_images):
            cropped_img.save(os.path.join(output_dir, f"{i}_{image_name}"))  
        full_image_with_boxes = draw_boxes(image, boxes)
        full_image_with_boxes.save(os.path.join(output_dir, f"full_{image_name}"))
